# Skill: Format Skill

## Purpose

Transform an anonymized experience into a properly formatted, PR-ready skill file. Generates either a complete SKILL.md (for new skills) or an AMENDMENT.yaml (for amendments to existing skills).

This is the final local step before the developer submits a PR.

## Triggers

- Called by anonymize-session after the developer approves the anonymized content
- Input: anonymized experience + verdict (new/amendment) + target skill info

## Behavior

### Case 1: New Skill

Generate a complete SKILL.md:

**IMPORTANT**: Skills MUST follow the [Agent Skills Open Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).
Only `name` and `description` are required in frontmatter. Everything else goes into `metadata`.

```yaml
---
name: [auto-generated-kebab-case]
description: [one-line description, max 1024 chars — what it does + when to use it]
license: MIT
metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
  tags: [auto-detected from context]
  session_tokens: [estimated tokens consumed — ask the user or read from Claude Code usage stats]
  author: anonymous-contributor
  source: session-contribution

# [Human Readable Name]

## Purpose
[Why this skill matters — what problem it prevents]

## Triggers
[When this skill should activate — specific conditions]
- [trigger 1]
- [trigger 2]

## Behavior
[Step by step what to do]
1. [step 1]
2. [step 2]
3. [step 3]

## Errors Prevented
[Real errors this prevents, with enough context to understand]
- **[Error name or message]**
  [Description of what happens, why it's hard to debug,
  how long it typically takes to figure out]

## Restrictions

### Hard Boundaries
[NEVER / MUST / ALWAYS rules]

### Soft Boundaries
[Prefer / by default / when possible rules]

## Self-Check
- [ ] [Verification item 1]
- [ ] [Verification item 2]
- [ ] [Verification item 3]

## Examples

### Example 1: [Happy path]
[Before/After or Scenario/Fix]

### Example 2 (Edge Case): [Edge case description]
[Before/After or Scenario/Fix]
```

### Case 2: Amendment

Generate an AMENDMENT.yaml:

```yaml
---
type: amendment
target_skill: [skill-name]
target_version: [current version]
source_sessions: 1
proposed_version: [bumped patch or minor]
---

# Additions

## Actions (append after step [N])
[N+1]. [new step]
[N+2]. [new step]

## Errors Prevented (append)
- **[New error name]**
  [Description of the new error this covers]

## Triggers (append)
- [new trigger condition]
```

### Step 3: Preview and instructions

```
Skill file generated successfully!

  Type: [New Skill / Amendment to X]
  File: skills/[name]/SKILL.md (or AMENDMENT.yaml)
  Repo: LaWebcapsule/d9-skills
  The submit-skill step will handle cloning, copying, and PR creation.

  [View file]  [Edit before submitting]  [Cancel]
```

### Step 4: Write the file for validation

Write the skill file to a temporary location for validation. The `submit-skill` step will clone `LaWebcapsule/d9-skills`, copy the validated file into `skills/[name]/`, and open a PR.

## Naming Convention

Auto-generate skill names from the experience:
- Use kebab-case
- Start with the domain: `deploy-`, `config-`, `env-`, `migration-`, `setup-`
- Be specific: `rebuild-plugins-before-deploy` not `fix-plugins`
- Max 40 characters

## Tag Auto-Detection

Assign tags based on context:
- File operations on `plugins/`, `extensions/` → `[deploy, plugins]`
- Error in `.env`, config → `[config, environment]`
- Platform-specific issue → `[platform, windows/linux/macos]`
- Database-related → `[database, migration]`
- CSS/UI issue → `[ui, css]`
- AWS/cloud → `[infra, aws]`

## Restrictions

- **Always show the generated file before placing it**: the dev must approve
- **Never overwrite an existing SKILL.md**: for amendments, create AMENDMENT.yaml alongside
- **Keep the language consistent**: if existing skills are in English, write in English
- **Don't invent information**: only include what was actually observed in the session
- **Version bumping for amendments**: patch bump for small additions (1.0.0 → 1.0.1), minor bump for significant additions (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

## Self-Check

- [ ] The generated file follows the exact SKILL.md or AMENDMENT.yaml format?
- [ ] The name is kebab-case, specific, and under 40 characters?
- [ ] Tags are relevant and consistent with existing skills?
- [ ] For amendments, the target skill and version are correct?
- [ ] The developer reviewed and approved the generated file?
- [ ] Instructions for PR submission were shown?
